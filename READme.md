# üö¶ Bangalore Traffic Analysis & Forecasting System  

A comprehensive data-driven analysis of **Bangalore‚Äôs traffic congestion patterns** using **Machine Learning, Visualization, and Geospatial Mapping**.  
This project leverages **data analytics and forecasting techniques** to identify high-congestion zones, predict future traffic trends, and visualize patterns on an interactive map.

---

##  Project Overview  

Traffic congestion is one of the most pressing urban issues in Bangalore.  
This project aims to analyze historical traffic data to uncover insights about congestion patterns, area-wise severity, and efficiency, while forecasting future traffic conditions.  

Through powerful libraries such as **Prophet**, **scikit-learn**, and **Folium**, this project delivers both analytical and visual perspectives on traffic behavior across the city.

## üìÇ Dataset  

- **Dataset Name:** `bangalore_traffic_dataset.csv`  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains detailed information on Bangalore‚Äôs traffic, including location, date, time, and congestion levels.  
  It enables analysis of temporal and spatial traffic patterns across multiple areas.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow  

### 1Ô∏è) Data Import & Preprocessing  
- Imported dataset using **pandas**.  
- Checked for null values, duplicates, and data consistency.  
- Extracted and organized relevant columns such as:
  - `Traffic Area`
  - `Date`
  - `Hour`
- Created a secondary table containing:
  - `Congestion Level`
  - `Congestion Severity`
  - `Traffic Efficiency`

### 2Ô∏è) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Performed comprehensive EDA using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to understand traffic patterns and visualize relationships:
- Top 5 most congested areas in Bangalore  
- Average congestion level by hour  
- Traffic volume vs. road capacity utilization  
- Traffic incidents by area  

Each visualization provided actionable insights into when and where congestion is most severe.

### 3Ô∏è) Predictive Forecasting  
Utilized **Facebook Prophet** to forecast future congestion levels based on historical data trends.  
This model predicts traffic behavior across time intervals, helping identify potential future bottlenecks.

### 4Ô∏è) Geospatial Visualization  
Implemented **Folium** and **Branca** to create an **interactive map** of Bangalore displaying:
- Congested areas  
- Severity markers (color-coded for easy interpretation)  
- Traffic flow efficiency zones  

The map provides a real-time visual perspective of the traffic situation.

### 5Ô∏è) Web Application Integration  
Used **Streamlit** to build an interactive and user-friendly dashboard, combining:
- Graphical analysis  
- Predictive charts  
- Real-time map visualization
